## Description

This project aims to develop and maintain an entirely new i3d exporter addon for Blender. The main goals are maintaining an exporter that is up to date with the newest Blender versions and adding long sought features such as skinned meshes, mergegroups and what ever else the community might have a need for.

The current status is that the exporter can do most of the things that the maya exporter can do and now makes Blender a viable option for creating mods for Giants Engine games.

## Documentation
The official documentation for the exporter can be found [here](https://stjerneidioten.github.io/I3D-Blender-Addon/) and will be updated as I go along. 

Currently a lot of things are missing and any help with documentation will be appreciated. The docs are hosted as a github page within this very repository and is built from the *docs* folder using sphinx and the Read the Docs theme, which you might recognize from Blenders own documentation.

The user **Redphoenix** from **VertexDezign** has been so kind as to put together two videos showcasing how to use the exporter, they can be found at the following links:
* [Redphoenix Youtube Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRDPuKh9gow): *Showing all of the most important features*
* [Redphoenix Youtube Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1jBP9EVauU&t=4s): *A complete exporting walktrough*

## Installation
Installation instructions can be found described in great detail [here](https://stjerneidioten.github.io/I3D-Blender-Addon/installation.html), but it's more or less just a standard Blender addon installation.

The newest release can always be found [here](https://github.com/StjerneIdioten/I3D-Blender-Addon/releases/latest) and the [releases page](https://github.com/StjerneIdioten/I3D-Blender-Addon/releases) contains all currently available releases. This consists of both legacy versions for older Blender versions and different development versions with experimental features.

The following table has an overview of the available exporter versions. Legacy versions are kept around for older Blender versions, but they are not actively developed anymore nor do they get new features or bug fixes.

## Help

If you need help with the addon in any way, the following channels are available:
* [Documentation](https://stjerneidioten.github.io/I3D-Blender-Addon): The documentation will eventually contain all information about every aspect of the exporter
* [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/StjerneIdioten/I3D-Blender-Addon/issues): If you come across any bugs, please post them here.
* [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/StjerneIdioten/I3D-Blender-Addon/discussions): The official discussion forum hosted here on github
* [VertexDezign Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vertexdezign): There is an official support channel available for the exporter

I can also be reached in several other places, I am not hard to find through my nickname. But please keep exporter related support to the official channels listed here. So that it might come in handy for anyone else with the same problem.
